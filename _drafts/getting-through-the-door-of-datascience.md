## Getting Through the Door

For those of us who have been fortunate to get through the door and land a data science job, one question we often get asked by aspiring data scientists is: "How do I land that first job?  Most data science jobs require 3-5 years of experience.  How do I do that?"

Among people I've talked to, one theme seems to be, "I was lucky to get my first data science job."  I think that about my own job.  What if that recruiter hadn't found me on LinkedIn?  What if I had been in a bad mood that day and decided not to respond to her?  What if I had been "off" when I talked to her and she hadn't forwarded my resume to the company?  

Fortunately, she found me and I responded, and responded well enough. But, after that first phone call, getting the job wasn't just about luck. I was ready. I had been studying, learning, figuring it out, and I could prove it by talking about it.  Sure, there was some luck involved, but the luck wouldn't have found me if I hadn't done the preparation.

### Don't Focus on Job Title

Don't be too focused on chasing the "data scientist" job title. While the article [job titles for data scientists](http://www.datasciencecentral.com/profiles/blogs/job-titles-for-data-scientists) is now a few years old, I think the lessons from it are still valid.  Focus on what you are doing, your responsibilities, not what your title is.  Note that my current title is "Software Developer, Machine Learning." This might be my title, but in conversations at the office I'm referred to as the data scientist. It might not be the exact same sort of data science that's performed at other companies, but I think most people in data science positions would recognize what I do as akin to their work. Companies have different reasons for naming different positions. One company's data scientist may be another company's data analyst may be a third company's business intelligence analyst. So when looking at job descriptions, focus on the responsibilities, not on the job title. 

### Most of Us Are Smart

If you get that data science job, or are doing well on your data science homework for class, don't pat yourself on the back too much. Everyone with some mild success in data science work, or classes, is likely to be intelligent. We are fortunate that our line of work attracts some very smart people. So how do you differentiate yourself from those other smart people?  One way, I believe, is by learning how to learn.
