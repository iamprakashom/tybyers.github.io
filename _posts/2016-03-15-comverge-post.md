Just a quick plug here. I work as a Data Scientist doing energy and demand response forecasting for [Comverge](www.comverge.com) in Denver, Colorado.  The marketing team asked me to put together a high-level overview of how we are using Machine Learning at the company.  If you are interested in learning more about how we use Data Science and Machine Learning techniques at Comverge, please [click through to see the blog post](http://blog.comverge.com/expert-insights/how-comverge-is-using-machine-learning-to-improve-demand-response-forecasts/).  I used R to do all my modeling and make the "Model 1" and "Model 2" charts.  My engineering team created the nice user interface using D3.
